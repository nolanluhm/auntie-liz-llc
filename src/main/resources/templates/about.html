<h1>About Auntie Liz, LLC:</h1>
<p>Auntie Liz, LLC is a small business that offers professional housekeeping and pet sitting services to clients in St. Louis and the surrounding
    areas. After contacting me with an appointment request, you will be assigned a housekeeper and we will finalize your appointment day and time.
    When your housekeeper arrives, they will start by cleaning all of your windows. Then they will dust, disinfect, and wipe down surfaces in each
    room. For bathrooms, your housekeeper will work their way from top to bottom and end with cleaning the toilet. Floors (whether hardwood, tile,
    linoleum, or carpeting) will be completed last. Those that opt for emptying waste cans will have this service completed from room-to-room.
    All cleaning supplies and equipment will be provided by Auntie Liz, LLC unless otherwise requested. Pet sitting details will be worked out with
    the client beforehand because every pet is different! </p>

<h1>About the Owner:</h1>
<p>Hello everyone and thank you for visiting my website! While working my way through college, I took on some cleaning and odd jobs. After
    achieving my MBA, I realized that working for a big corporation was not a good fit for me. I decided to start my own housekeeping and pet
    sitting business because I enjoyed the relationships I made with my first couple of clients. I require a flexible schedule due to family
    commitments and health conditions, so starting my own business was a logical fit for my lifestyle. I find that helping others, whether it be
    through housekeeping or not, to be a fulfilling way to lead my life. Animals have always been my passion, whether it was working as a
    veterinary technician for many years or choosing this new career path. Having recently just come into business in June of 2020, I will admit
    that there is a learning curve to owning my own business and gaining clientele. COVID 19 has also provided its own, unique challenges.
    My goal is to eventually hire multiple housekeepers and expand my business, but I canâ€™t do it without your help. Thank you again for your
    consideration! </p>
